Carpooling Application

When you start the application, two buttons appear: "Passenger" and "Driver". You need to choose one based on whether you are looking for a route or offering one. After selecting, you must register if you are not already registered. You can register with the same email as both a passenger and a driver, but you cannot register twice as a passenger (or a driver) with the same email. If you are a driver, you will need to provide additional information about your vehicle. After registration, you will need to log in. Depending on whether you selected "Passenger" and "Driver", you will be redirected to the respective activity.

Passenger:
- In this activity you can rotate your phone (I add landscape).
- Your rating and a list of available routes will be displayed.
- You can search for your desired destination. 
- Clicking the "Search Destination" button will first show your current location. Then, a search view will appear where you can enter your destination and click "Save". 
- The "Save" button will take you back to a filtered list of active drivers, sorted from the closest to the farthest based on the destination.
- Choose your desired route and click "More.." to see the details of the driver, route, and price. 
- Click "Accept Ride" (the button will become disabled) to proceed. Two buttons will appear: "Rate Driver" and "Follow Ride".
  - You can rate the driver and update the rating if needed.
  - You can also follow the route. The map will show three markers: the driver's current location, the pickup point, and the destination.
  - There is an "EndRide" button on the map, which only the driver can use to complete the ride.
- You have a "MyRides" button where all accepted routes are stored.
- There is also a "Logout" button.

 Driver Features:
- Your rating and a list of "Completed Routes" (your past rides) will be displayed.
- Clicking "More.." provides the option to follow a route and leave a rating for the passenger, but only if a passenger has selected your route. 
- In the "FollowRide" section, clicking the "EndRide" button will complete the route and display a message confirming its completion.
- At the top-right corner, in the Menu you will see three buttons:
  1. "Logout"
  2. "Details**, where you can edit your information and vehicle details.
  3. "AddRoute", where you can select two locations (start and end) on the map and set a price. Clicking "Save" will save the route.
